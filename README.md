Solutions to the exercises in Fluid Dynamics book by Anatoly I. Ruban  
I am going to publish solutions to the exercises in Fluid Dynamics by Prof Ruban every Sunday. The notes are handwritten however, if want me to type up the solutions in Latex (PDF) please leave a comment. Hereâ€™s the link to the  Fluid Dynamics: Part 2 book: Asymptotic Problems of Fluid Dynamics [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fluid-Dynamics-Part-Boundary-Layers/dp/0199681759](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fluid-Dynamics-Part-Asymptotic-Problems/dp/0199681740)

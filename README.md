# Asymptotics-and-perturbation-methods
I am going to publish solutions to the exercises in the booked called Fluid Dynamics II by Prof Ruban here, every Sunday. The notes are handwritten however, if want me to type up the solutions in Latex (PDF) please leave a comment. Hereâ€™s the link to the  Fluid Dynamics: Part 2 book: Asymptotic Problems of Fluid Dynamics [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fluid-Dynamics-Part-Boundary-Layers/dp/0199681759](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fluid-Dynamics-Part-Asymptotic-Problems/dp/0199681740)
